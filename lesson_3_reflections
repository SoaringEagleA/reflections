When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

This can be very helpful to have a backup for my individual projects and to share files 
of collaborative projects with collaborators.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

It's nice and important to decide whether to pull changes, based on
the suitablility and quality evaluation of other commits at the remote repository.
