When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

This can be very helpful to have a backup for my individual projects and to share files 
of collaborative projects with collaborators.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

It's nice and important to decide whether to pull changes, based on
the suitablility and quality evaluation of other commits at the remote repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
   forks: on github, copied from another github repository,      independent repository afterwards

   branches: structures of local and remote/public/github repository, good for managing new/different/experiment features

   clones: make a local copy of a remote/global github repository, the github repository automatically becomes the origin of the local repo
