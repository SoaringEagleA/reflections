How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It only shows the difference and makes it easy to see the bug.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    You can go back to a previous version when needed and 
    don't have to worry about saving multiple versions yourself.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Manual choices give an author more responsibility and hopefully
    thoughtful decisons to record significant changes.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Multiple files in one commit shows correlation among files.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    I don't know yet.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    You can go back to previous version.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    commit recover ...
